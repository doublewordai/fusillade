//! Batching system for HTTP requests with retry logic and concurrency control.
//!
//! This crate provides 'managers' that accept submitted HTTP requests, and provides an API for
//! checking their status over time. Behind the scenes, a daemon processes these requests in
//! batches, retrying failed requests with exponential backoff and enforcing concurrency limits
//!
//! Batching system with PostgreSQL storage and background daemon for processing requests.
